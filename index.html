        <h3>Tourism in India</h3>
        <p>Tourism in India is important for the country's economy and is growing rapidly. The World Travel and Tourism
            Council calculated that tourism generated ₹13.2 lakh crore (US$170 billion) or 5.8% of India's GDP and
            supported 32.1 million jobs in 2021. Even though, these numbers were lower than the pre-pandemic figures;
            the country's economy witnessed a significant growth in 2021 after the massive downturn during 2020. The
            sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 7.8% to ₹33.8 lakh crore (US$420 billion) by 2031 (7.2% of
            GDP).[1] In October 2015, India's medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is
            projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020.[2] In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients travelled to India to seek
            medical treatment.[3]<br>

            Over 17.9 million foreign tourists arrived in India in 2019 compared to 17.4 million in 2018, representing a
            growth of 3.5%.[4] This makes India the 22nd most visited nation in the world and 8th in Asia and Pacific
            .[5] Domestic tourist visits to all states and union territories numbered 1,036.35 million in 2012, an
            increase of 16.5% from 2011.[6] In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named the state Kerala as
            one of the "ten paradises of the world" and "50 must see destinations of a lifetime".[7] In 2014, Tamil
            Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh were the most popular states for tourists.[8] Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai,
            Agra and Jaipur were the five most visited cities of India by foreign tourists during the year 2015. As of
            2017, worldwide, Delhi is ranked 28th by the number of foreign tourist arrivals, while Mumbai is ranked
            30th, Chennai 43rd, Agra 45th, Jaipur 52nd and Kolkata 90th.[9]<br>

            The World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index 2021, which replaced its previous Travel and
            Tourism Competitiveness Report, ranks India 54th out of 117 countries overall.[10] The last edition of the
            Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, published in 2019, had ranked India 34th out of 140 countries
            overall. The report ranked the price competitiveness of India's tourism sector 13th out of 140 countries. It
            mentioned that India has quite good air transport infrastructure (ranked 33rd), particularly given the
            country's stage of development, and reasonable ground and port infrastructure (ranked 28th). The country
            also scored high on natural resources (ranked 14th), and cultural resources and business travel (ranked
            8th).[11] The World Tourism Organization reported that India's receipts from tourism during 2012 ranked 16th
            in the world, and 7th among Asian and Pacific countries.[12]<br>

            The Ministry of Tourism designs national policies for the development and promotion of tourism. In the
            process, the Ministry consults and collaborates with other stakeholders in the sector including various
            central ministries/agencies, state governments, union territories and private sector representatives.
            Concerted efforts are being made to promote niche tourism products such as rural, cruise, medical and
            eco-tourism.[13] The Ministry of Tourism maintains the Incredible India campaign focused on promoting
            tourism in India.
